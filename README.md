# 🌞 Eclipse Simulation (Solar & Lunar)

### *A Minimalistic Interactive Visualization of Celestial Geometry*  
**Created by Dhruv — Engineering & MBA Tech Student, NMIMS MPSTME**

## 🧭 Overview

This project is a **browser-based eclipse simulator** that models both **Solar** and **Lunar Eclipses** using accurate celestial geometry.  
It visualizes how the **Sun, Moon, and Earth** align during eclipses and shows the **fraction of light blocked (light curve)** dynamically over time.

Built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project demonstrates the intersection of physics, geometry, and programming in an elegant, interactive, and educational way.  
It is designed for **students, educators, and astronomy enthusiasts** who want to visually explore eclipse mechanics.

## 📚 Educational Concepts Demonstrated

- Apparent angular radius:  
  \( \alpha = \arctan(R/d) \approx R/d \)
- Circle–circle intersection area to find obscuration fraction  
- Umbra & penumbra cone geometry using similar triangles  
- Flux variation (light curve) computation  
- Visualization of motion and geometry in 2D projection
